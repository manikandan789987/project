# Best Buy Clone

Best Buy is an American multinational consumer electronics retailer headquartered in Richfield, Minnesota.
It was originally found as an audio specialty store called Sound of Music, and was rebranded under its current name with an emphasis on consumer electronics in 1983.

As part of our group project in Unit 2 at Masai School, we were given to build the clone of the bestbuy website.
